The **Venue Booking** feature for the **Fantopark** ecosystem, comprising two components: **Academy-Side Slot Management** in the Fantopark Coach App and **Parent-Side Venue Booking** in the Fantopark Parents App. The feature enables academies to manage slots for courts or grounds (e.g., cricket pitches, football fields, badminton courts) and allows users (parents, individuals, or groups, not limited to students) to book these venues for recreational or competitive use.
