## **Feature: Tournament Planner**

**As a** coach or tournament organizer,  
**I want** to plan and manage sports tournaments while factoring in the maximum number of matches per day,  
**So that** I can determine how many entries (players or teams) the tournament can accommodate without scheduling conflicts **and still have the flexibility to manually schedule or adjust matches when needed.**

---

## **1. Fixture Generator**

### **Tournament Format Selection**

- **Scenario**: The organizer chooses the format of the tournament.
- **Options**:
    1. **Knockout**: Single- or double-elimination brackets.
    2. **League**: Round-robin or group-based league.
    3. **Combination**: Group stages leading into knockout rounds (e.g., group stage → quarterfinals).

- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer selects the desired format.
    2. The system displays relevant fields (e.g., number of rounds, group sizes, bracket structure).
    3. Organizer saves the setup, and the Fixture Generator is ready to build schedules.

- **Outcome**: A tailored fixture setup is prepared, aligned with the chosen tournament format.

---

### **Number of Courts/Grounds**

- **Scenario**: The organizer specifies the available venues or courts for the tournament.
- **Steps**:
    1. Organizer enters the number of courts/grounds (e.g., Court #1, Court #2, Main Field).
    2. The system maps each match to a specific court, preventing scheduling clashes.

- **Outcome**: The system knows exactly how many matches can run concurrently, ensuring efficient court usage.

---

### **Maximum Matches Per Day**

- **Scenario**: The organizer needs to define how many matches can feasibly be played each day, based on total courts, match duration, and operational constraints.
- **Steps**:

    1. The system calculates or allows manual entry for the **maximum matches per day**.
        - Potential inputs include:
            - Number of courts
            - Average match duration
            - Daily operational hours (e.g., 8 hrs, 10 hrs)
            - Buffer times (breaks, court maintenance, etc.)
    2. The system uses this figure to **cap total registrations**, ensuring no unrealistic schedules.
    3. If registrations exceed daily capacity, the system:
        - Alerts the organizer, or
        - Suggests an extended schedule (more days)

- **Outcome**: The tournament stays within daily limits, preventing overbooking and ensuring match completion within allotted time.

---

### **Player List**

- **Scenario**: The organizer registers or imports a list of players/teams into the system.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer adds or imports player data (e.g., names, skill levels, age brackets).
    2. System cross-checks participant count against the max matches/day limit.
    3. If the new additions exceed capacity, the organizer receives a warning or must adjust scheduling.

- **Outcome**: The final roster remains valid and manageable given the tournament’s day-by-day constraints.

---

### **Referee List**

- **Scenario**: The organizer assigns referees/officials to each match.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer adds referee details (e.g., name, certification, availability).
    2. System stores these details for automatic (or manual) match assignments.
    3. Schedule ensures each match is assigned a referee who is available at that time and location.

- **Outcome**: Every match has appropriate officiating, maintaining fairness and consistency.

---

### **Single-Day Tournaments**

- **Scenario**: The organizer runs the entire event in just one day.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer selects “Single-Day” and sets a daily match limit (no overflow to subsequent days).
    2. The system arranges all matches on that single day.
    3. Real-time updates happen as matches conclude (finished court → next match assignment).

- **Outcome**: A compact, high-intensity schedule without surpassing the daily limit.

---

### **Multiple-Day Tournaments**

- **Scenario**: The tournament spans multiple days.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer enters the start and end dates.
    2. System prompts for the **maximum matches per day** or auto-calculates it.
    3. Matches distribute across the range of days, respecting daily capacity, rest times, and referee schedules.
    4. The schedule updates daily with real-time results, feeding into subsequent rounds.

- **Outcome**: A well-structured, multi-day schedule that avoids overloading any particular day.

---

### **Manual Scheduling Option**

- **Scenario**: The organizer wants the flexibility to manually create or adjust specific matches rather than relying solely on automated scheduling.
- **Steps**:
    1. Organizer selects a match from the generated schedule or creates a new fixture manually.
    2. Sets the date, time, and court/ground for that match.
    3. Chooses a referee and assigns players/teams directly.
    4. The system validates this change against daily match limits and court availability before finalizing.
- **Outcome**: The organizer can override or refine the automated schedule for special requirements or last-minute changes, ensuring full control while still respecting capacity constraints.

---

### **Real-Time Match Updates & Progression**

- **Scenario**: Matches are played, results recorded, and subsequent matches update automatically.
- **Steps**:

    1. Referees or authorized staff enter final scores.
    2. The system instantly updates the bracket/league table with winners and next matchups.
    3. Unoccupied courts get newly scheduled matches if available.
    4. Manual overrides remain possible for rescheduling or adjustments as needed.

- **Outcome**: Ongoing, dynamic scheduling that reflects current progress, keeping everyone informed in real time.

---

### **Sports-Based Scoring & Results**

- **Scenario**: Different sports require different scoring methods (e.g., sets in tennis, goals in soccer).
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer chooses or configures the scoring format (e.g., best-of-3 sets, points, runs).
    2. Referee inputs the result in the correct format (e.g., 6-4, 6-3 in tennis).
    3. The system calculates the winner and updates bracket or league records.

- **Outcome**: Accurate, sport-specific results that feed directly into the next stage of the tournament.

---

### **Milestones Calculation**

- **Scenario**: Players, referees, or teams achieve notable milestones (e.g., 100th goal, 50 matches officiated).
- **Steps**:

    1. System tracks relevant stats.
    2. When thresholds are met, it generates a milestone notification or badge (e.g., “Congratulate Referee Anna on 50 matches officiated!”).

- **Outcome**: Enhanced engagement and recognition for key achievements throughout the event.

---

### **Tournament Summary & Prizes**

- **Scenario**: After all matches finish, the organizer compiles final results.
- **Steps**:

    1. The system aggregates final placements, match stats, top scorers, etc.
    2. Organizer can edit or confirm prize distribution.
    3. A shareable summary (PDF or in-app) becomes available for participants and records.

- **Outcome**: A clear, concise tournament wrap-up that highlights winners and fosters community celebration.

---

## **2. Tournament Registration Form**

### **Registration Deadline**

- **Scenario**: The organizer sets a cutoff date for entries.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer specifies an end date/time for sign-ups.
    2. The system automatically closes or hides the form after that moment.

- **Outcome**: Avoids last-minute disruptions or schedule expansions.

---

### **Registration Fee Options**

- **Scenario**: The organizer can opt for online or on-site fee collection.
- **Steps**:

    1. Organizer sets a fee (if any).
    2. Participants can pay online immediately or opt for on-site payment.
    3. The system tracks paid vs. unpaid participants, giving the organizer a real-time overview.

- **Outcome**: Flexible fee handling with clear visibility of payment status.

### **Additional Considerations**

1. **Dynamic Adjustments**

    - If organizers extend hours or add courts, the system can recalculate daily limits.
    - Manual scheduling can override or supplement these recalculations for special scenarios.

2. **Participant Communication**

    - Emails, in-app messages, or SMS to share bracket changes, match times, or last-minute adjustments.

3. **Spectator View**

    - Option to publicly display bracket progress, match schedules, and live results to engage viewers.

4. **Data Security & Privacy**
    - Ensure participant details, payment info, and match data remain encrypted and accessible only to authorized roles.

5. **Livestreaming**
    - After a robust setup for this is done, feature for livestreaming can be picked up as to create more credibility for players and and engagement for their friends and family.
