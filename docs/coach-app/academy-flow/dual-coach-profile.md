![Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-ReadyForReview-yellow)

### Feature: Dual Coach Profiles

**As a** coach,  
**I want** to maintain distinct profiles for my personal coaching business and for each academy I’m affiliated with,  
**So that** I can keep financial, scheduling, and communication channels separate, ensuring clarity and privacy for all parties.

### User Flow & Detailed Steps

1. **Setting Up Multiple Profiles**

    - **Scenario**: A coach has existing ties to an academy (where they have restricted access) but also wants to run personal batches independently.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Upon signing up (or within account settings), the coach is prompted to create additional profiles:
        - **Academy Profile**: Tied to a specific academy, with restricted access to guardian info and fee data (depending on academy permissions).
        - **Personal Profile**: Fully managed by the coach, offering direct guardian contact, fee control, and custom scheduling.
        2. The coach selects “Create New Profile” and specifies if it’s an **Academy Linked** profile (entering academy details) or a **Personal** profile.
        3. Each profile has its own branding, fee structures, and contact permissions aligned with the chosen context.
    - **Outcome**: The coach can toggle between profiles, ensuring that operations under each remain distinct and properly managed.

2. **Switching Between Profiles**

    - **Scenario**: The coach wants to manage personal batches after updating attendance in an academy-affiliated batch.
    - **Steps**:
        1. From the coach’s dashboard, a “Switch Profile” option allows choosing between **Academy X** or **Personal**.
        2. The system reloads to display all relevant batches, players, and financial tools for the selected profile.
        3. Notifications and messages are sorted or filtered based on the active profile.
    - **Outcome**: The coach stays organized, preventing mix-ups of scheduling, payments, or communications across personal and academy contexts.

3. **Managing Batches Under Each Profile**

    - **Scenario**: The coach creates or edits batches, ensuring each is properly associated with the correct profile.
    - **Steps**:
        1. In the **Academy Profile**, batch creation might be restricted or require admin approval (per academy policy).
        2. In the **Personal Profile**, the coach can freely create “Independent Batches,” set fees, and handle direct enrollment.
        3. Players, attendance records, and performance data belong solely to the profile under which they’re created.
    - **Outcome**: Clear demarcation of which batches belong to the academy and which ones are personal, minimizing confusion for both the coach and students.

4. **Financial and Guardian Data Separation**

    - **Scenario**: The coach wants to view payment statuses for personal batches but has no access to fees in the academy batches.
    - **Steps**:
        1. While using the **Academy Profile**, the coach can only see or do what the academy permits (e.g., mark attendance, view partial player info).
        2. By switching to the **Personal Profile**, the coach gains full control of fee information, overdue payments, and direct guardian contacts.
        3. Any changes in one profile (like updating personal batch fees) remain hidden in the other, preserving privacy.
    - **Outcome**: Strict data separation ensures that the academy’s confidentiality is upheld, while the coach can independently manage personal finances.

5. **Consolidated Notification Center**

    - **Scenario**: The coach needs a unified view of urgent tasks but still maintain separation of details.
    - **Steps**:
        1. The app provides a **Notification Center** with filters: **All Profiles**, **Academy Profile**, **Personal Profile**.
        2. The coach can quickly see attendance alerts, messages from guardians, or academy announcements grouped by profile.
        3. Clicking on a specific notification automatically switches to the relevant profile and displays the detailed context.
    - **Outcome**: The coach efficiently manages day-to-day operations without mixing or losing important communications from different sources.

6. **Profile-Specific Reporting**

    - **Scenario**: The coach needs to generate performance or financial reports independently for personal batches and academy sessions.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Under each profile, the coach accesses a “Reports” section (performance, attendance, financial).
        2. **Academy Profile**: Some reports might be restricted or generated by academy admins. The coach can only view permissible data.
        3. **Personal Profile**: The coach can fully customize and generate reports for all personal batches, including financial statements.
    - **Outcome**: Comprehensive reporting is maintained without mixing data from different profiles.
