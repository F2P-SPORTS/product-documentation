### Key Features

1. **Academy Onboarding & Setup**

    - **Verified Identity**: Academies complete a simple KYC process to ensure authenticity, building trust for students and parents.
    - **Customizable Profile**: Easily create a branded academy profile with logos, location details, and sports programs offered.
    - **Tiered Subscription Plans**: Select from various plans that match your scale—smaller academies opt for basic features, larger ones unlock advanced analytics and branding.
    - **Administrative Roles**: Define roles (Admin, Manager, Support) to safeguard sensitive data like fee records and guardian contacts.

2. **Inviting & Managing Coaches**

    - **Simple Invitations**: Send invites to potential coaches by phone number or email. Coaches can also request to join by providing the academy owner’s contact.

    - **Roles & Permissions**: Assign custom access levels—restrict coaches from viewing fees or guardian info if desired, ensuring data security.
    - **Coach Activity Tracking**: Monitor each coach’s batch assignments, attendance tracking, and session feedback for better oversight.

3. **Academy-Controlled Batch & Player Details**

    - **Centralized Batch Creation**: Only academy administrators or designated managers can create and edit training batches, ensuring consistent scheduling and fee structures.
    - **Secure Player Management**: Add or remove players with full control of fee statuses and guardian contact details, keeping sensitive data private.
    - **Automated Fee Tracking**: Manage payments and send reminders directly from the academy interface; restricted coaches see only relevant training information.

4. **Separate Coach Profiles (Academy & Personal)**

    - **Dual Profile System**: Coaches can maintain one profile for academy-affiliated sessions (with restricted privileges) and another for independent batches (with full control).
    - **Seamless Switching**: Quickly toggle between academy and personal profiles, preventing mix-ups in schedules, payments, and communications.
    - **Data Segregation**: Financial and contact info remains separate—coaches see fees for personal batches, while academy data is locked behind admin permissions.

5. **Streamlined Approval Flow**

    - **Two-Way Verification**: Both the academy and the coach must approve each other, guaranteeing valid partnerships and preventing unauthorized affiliations.
    - **Notifications & Alerts**: Requests, invites, and approvals appear in a dedicated queue, making it easy to track pending actions.
    - **Audit & Review**: Easily review all active affiliations and coach roles, updating or revoking access as needed to keep records accurate.
