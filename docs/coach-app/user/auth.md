## Mobile Number Authentication Flow (OTP Based)

### Step 1: Enter Mobile Number
Coaches input their mobile number in the login screen.

### Step 2: Receive OTP
An OTP is sent to the entered mobile number via SMS.

### Step 3: OTP Verification
The coach enters the received OTP to verify their mobile number.

### Step 4: Token-Based Authentication
After successful OTP verification, an authentication token (JWT or similar) is generated and stored on the client side. This token is used for authenticating subsequent requests to secure endpoints.

### Step 5: Profile Completion
Upon first login, the coach is directed to the profile completion page where they must provide:
- Personal Information: Name, contact details, bio.
- Professional Details: Coaching experience, sports expertise.
- Certifications: Upload coaching certificates and other qualifications.
- Profile Photo: Upload a profile picture.

## Registration Flow for Coaches

### Step 1: Mobile Number Entry
Coaches register by providing their mobile number.

### Step 5: Subscription Tier Selection
Coaches can choose a subscription tier based on the services and features they need access to within the app.

### Step 6: Dashboard Access
After registration and profile completion, the coach gains access to their dashboard, where they can manage batches, track attendance, communicate with students, and more.

## Session Management

- **Token Expiration**: Tokens are configured to expire after a specific period to enhance security. If the token expires, the coach is prompted to log in again.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed in the background to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Logout**: Coaches can log out manually, which revokes the token and ends the session.

---

## Security Considerations
- **OTP Security**: OTPs are time-sensitive and valid for a limited duration to prevent misuse.
- **Token Security**: Authentication tokens are securely stored to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Encryption**: All data exchanges between the app and the server are encrypted using HTTPS.

## API Endpoints (Sample)

- **POST /auth/login**  
  Logs in the coach by verifying the mobile number and OTP, returning an authentication token.

- **POST /auth/verify-otp**  
  Verifies the OTP sent to the coachâ€™s mobile number.

- **POST /auth/logout**  
  Logs the coach out, revoking the token and ending the session.

- **POST /auth/complete-profile**  
  Allows the coach to complete their profile by uploading personal information and certifications.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid OTP**: If the OTP is incorrect or expired, the coach is prompted to request a new OTP.
- **Token Expiration**: Expired tokens prompt the coach to log in again.
- **Profile Incomplete**: Coaches are unable to access certain features until their profile is fully completed.
